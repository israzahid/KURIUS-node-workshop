### What is Back-End Development?
- Also known as 'server-side' development
- How the site 'works'
- Consists of a server, application and database
	- Server: 'serves up' your website on the browser
	- Application: any logic you want your website to have
	- Database: what stores data you might need

- Think of any website you've had to create an account for
	- Restaurant analogy: client-side (dining area), server (kitchen), database (ingredient storage)
- Back-end is hidden from the user: 
	- Database administration
	- Security
	- Data transformation
- Front-end is what the user sees:
	- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	- Accessibility
	- General look and feel

### What is NodeJS?
- A back-end platform to help us create the back-end for our websites
- A lot of different technologies available out there
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is based off JavaScript 
	- (kind of an obvious choice for us)
- There are a lot of advantages for choosing a particular language but we'll just explore NodeJS for now
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) will be our framework
	- Framework's just make it easier to use NodeJS, cutting down on the amount of code we need to write

### Setting Up Your Environment
- You'll need an IDE
	- VSCode (my favourite and what I'll be using)
	- Sublime
	- Atom
- Install Node
	- [MacOS](https://nodesource.com/blog/installing-nodejs-tutorial-mac-os-x/)
	- [Windows](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows)
- Extra: You can also install nodemon (will make it easier to run our app)
	- On your terminal: `npm install -g nodemon`
	- Note: you'll only be able to install this after you've installed NodeJS
